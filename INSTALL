Installation Instructions
*************************

WFoverlap binaries

In order to install the wfoverlap program, which is necessary for many functionalities in SHARC, go to the respective source directory

cd wfoverlap/source

edit the Makefile appropriately, and issue the command:

make wfoverlap_ascii.x

If you have the COLUMBUS-MOLCAS interface installed on your system, set $COLUMBUS and then 

make wfoverlap.x

to compile the full version of wfoverlap.x (only needed for SHARC dynamics with COLUMBUS and Dyson norm computations with MOLCAS).
Note that if you only compile wfoverlap_ascii.x, then make will create a symbolic link wfoverlap.x pointing to wfoverlap_ascii.x.

To test the installation, run inside the source directory

make test
